## About

I am a current sophomore at the University of Notre Dame studying Computer Science and Engineering and Engineering Corporate Practice. I am originally from New Egypt, New Jersey, a small town about 30 minutes outside of Princeton. This website displays some projects that I have completed and that I am currently working on, so I hope you enjoy!
